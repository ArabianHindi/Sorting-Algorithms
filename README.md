# Sorting-Algorithms
a program in C++ that works as follows:
• The user is allowed to choose from a printed menu the list to be sorted as follows:
1. Sortedlist
2. InverselySortedList 
3. RandomList

• Then the user is allowed to choose the specific sorting technique to be applied to sort the previously selected list, among the following:

1. MergeSort 
2. HeapSort 
3. QuickSort 
4. Allofthem

• The program determines the number of comparisons, assignment statements and swap done for each sorting technique.

• The program measures the time consumed to sort the list in each sorting technique.

• The program displays a comparison among the sorting techniques’ regarding the number of comparisons, the assignment statements and the time consumed to sort a random list. That’s when the user chooses all of them.
